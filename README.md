# my-portfolio
A demonstration of my progress as a developer
## HEN short stack
This page is rendered using **H**andlebars on an **E**xpress server in **N**ode.js
- I might at some point move the projects into a MongoDB and call the db for the carousel and the rain if I decide to go full stack on it
- I will likely also migrate from Handlebars to React
### Styling
- Materialize
- my own ingenuity
